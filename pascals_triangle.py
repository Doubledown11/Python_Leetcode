"""
Leetcode Q 118 -- Pascal's Triangle.

Simplified Time Complexity:
O(n)- I think?

Constraints:
    1 <= numRows <= 30

I struggled with this one. It's been some time however, and I do not 
know where I got this solution from unfortunately.

def generate(numRows): 
    # Check Constraint 1: 
    if numRows < 1 or numRows > 30:
        print("Invalid input!")
        exit()

    if numRows == 0: 
        return [] 
    
    if numRows == 1: 
        return [[1]]

    # prevRows is a list which holds the row lists and represents the triangle itself.    
    prevRows = generate(numRows -1) 
    

    # Create a new row filled with 1â€™s in len of the current row count. 
    # so we have a row with 5 possible values in it.
    newRow = [1] * numRows 
    
    for i in range(1, numRows - 1): 
        # We start at 1, BC first val (index 0) in row is auto = to 1. 
        # and we only go to the second last val since the last in the row is also = 1 
        # IE) [1,_,_,_,1]
        newRow[i] = prevRows[-1][i-1] + prevRows[-1][i]
        
    # After a row is created and filled, we append it to the end of the triangle list, and thus say we have created another row or layer to the triangle.
    prevRows.append(newRow)
